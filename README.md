# Project Starter Repository

This is a simple starter repository with **development (dev)**, **testing (test)**, and **production (main)** branches.

- `dev` → development (feature branches merge here)
- `test` → staging/testing (promote from dev)
- `main` → production (protected; final deploys)

See `docs/SETUP_STEPS_GITHUB_UI.md` for setup steps.
